<div class="CSection"><div class=CTopic><h2 class=CTitle><a name="Evolutionary_Algorithms"></a>Evolutionary Algorithms</h2><div class=CBody><p>Evolutionary Algorithms are a super set of CGP.</p><p>In order to explain CGP first Evolutionary Algorithms will be introduced.</p><p>Evolutionary Algorithms are a set Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning search heuristics based on Darwinian evolution.&nbsp; The idea is to describe a &lsquo;population&rsquo; of multiple solutions to a given task in software.&nbsp; Where each solution is called a &lsquo;chromosome&rsquo; or &lsquo;genotype&rsquo; taking the terminology form biology.&nbsp; Each of these chromosomes (solutions) is then assessed a &lsquo;fitness&rsquo; score indicating how well it solves the given task.&nbsp; The fittest of these chromosome are then kept and the weakest removed mimicking survival of the fittest or natural selection.&nbsp; The remaining chromosomes are then treated as &lsquo;parents&rsquo; and used to create new &lsquo;child&rsquo; chromosomes.&nbsp; This process can involve sexual or asexual reproduction i.e. use one parent or two.&nbsp; These new &lsquo;child&rsquo; chromosomes (with/without their parents) form the population of the next &lsquo;generation&rsquo;.&nbsp; This process is repeated until a &lsquo;termination condition&rsquo; is reached.&nbsp; Termination conditions often include a target fitness for a chromosome to reach and a time restraint.</p><p>The process is shown below in pseudo code</p><blockquote><pre class="prettyprint">create initial population

while(! terminated)

    calculate chromosome fitnesses
    Select parent chromosomes
    create new population form parents

end</pre></blockquote><p>Evolutionary Algorithms therefore involve several stages which are now described further.</p><ul><li>creating initial population</li><li>calculating fitnesses</li><li>selection</li><li>reproduction</li></ul><h4 class=CHeading>Creating Initial Population</h4><p>The original population typically takes one of two forms.&nbsp; Either it is populated with randomly generated chromosomes or it is seeded with specific chromosomes.&nbsp; These specific chromosomes may include partial solutions which need to be completed or current solutions which might be improved.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Calculating Fitnesses</h4><p>The function which assigns a fitness to each chromosome is commonly called the fitness function.&nbsp; How the fitness function operates is dependant upon the problem being solved and the chromosome encoding but it must assign a fitness value to each chromosome.&nbsp; As this fitness value is only used to choose between chromosomes, it is not necessary that the perfect fitness be known; only that one chromosome is better than another.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Selection</h4><p>The method used to select the members of the population to be kept is referred to as the &lsquo;selection scheme&rsquo;.&nbsp; Selections schemes can be very simple, just select the fittest chromosomes, or more complex, select chromosomes which represent the most novel solutions.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Reproduction</h4><p>There are two main ways in which new child chromosomes can be created from their parents.&nbsp; The first mimics asexual reproduction where the child is simply a mutated copy of the parent chromosome.&nbsp; The second mimics sexual reproduction where the child contains genetic material from both parents with or without mutation.&nbsp; The second method is refereed to as &lsquo;recombination&rsquo; or &lsquo;crossover&rsquo;.&nbsp; How mutation and recombination are implemented depends on the encoding of the chromosomes.</p></div></div></div>
