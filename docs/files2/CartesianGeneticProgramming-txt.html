<div class="CSection"><div class=CTopic><h2 class=CTitle><a name="Evolutionary_Algorithms"></a>Evolutionary Algorithms</h2><div class=CBody><p>Evolutionary Algorithms are a superset of CGP.&nbsp; In order to explain CGP first Evolutionary Algorithms are introduced.</p><p>Evolutionary Algorithms are a set Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning search heuristics based on Darwinian evolution.&nbsp; The idea is to describe a &lsquo;population&rsquo; of possible solutions to a given task in software.&nbsp; Here each solution is called a &lsquo;chromosome&rsquo; or &lsquo;genotype&rsquo; taking the terminology form biology.&nbsp; Each of these chromosomes (solutions) is then assessed and given a &lsquo;fitness&rsquo; score indicating how well it performs on a given task.&nbsp; The fittest of these chromosome are then kept and the weakest removed mimicking survival of the fittest or natural selection.&nbsp; The remaining chromosomes are then treated as &lsquo;parents&rsquo; and used to create new &lsquo;child&rsquo; chromosomes.&nbsp; This process can involve sexual or asexual reproduction i.e. use one parent or two.&nbsp; These new &lsquo;child&rsquo; chromosomes (with/without their parents) form the population of the next &lsquo;generation&rsquo;.&nbsp; This process is repeated until a &lsquo;termination condition&rsquo; is reached.&nbsp; Termination conditions often include finding a suitable solution and a time restraint.</p><p>The process is shown below in pseudo code</p><blockquote><pre>create initial population of chromosomes

while(solution not found)

  calculate chromosome fitnesses
  Select parent chromosomes
  create next generation chromosomes

end</pre></blockquote><p>Evolutionary Algorithms therefore involve several stages which are now described further.</p><ul><li>creating initial population</li><li>calculating fitnesses</li><li>selection</li><li>reproduction</li></ul><h4 class=CHeading>Creating Initial Population</h4><p>The original population typically takes one of two forms.&nbsp; Either it is populated with randomly generated chromosomes or it is seeded with specific chromosomes.&nbsp; These specific chromosomes may include partial solutions which need to be completed or known solutions to be refined.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Calculating Fitnesses</h4><p>The function which assigns a fitness to each chromosome is commonly called the &lsquo;fitness function&rsquo;.&nbsp; How the fitness function operates is dependant upon the problem being solved and the chromosome encoding, it must however assign a fitness value to each chromosome.&nbsp; As this fitness value is only used to choose between chromosomes it is not necessary that the perfect fitness be known; only that one chromosome is fitter than another.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Selection</h4><p>The method used to select the members of the population to survive and/or breed is referred to as the &lsquo;selection scheme&rsquo;.&nbsp; Selections schemes can be very simple, just select the fittest chromosomes, or more complex, select chromosomes which represent the most novel solutions.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Reproduction</h4><p>There are two main ways in which new child chromosomes can be created from their parents.&nbsp; The first mimics asexual reproduction where the child is simply a mutated copy of the parent chromosome.&nbsp; The second mimics sexual reproduction where the child contains genetic material from both parents with or without mutation.&nbsp; This former method is refereed to as &lsquo;recombination&rsquo; or &lsquo;crossover&rsquo;.&nbsp; How mutation and recombination are implemented again depends on the encoding of the chromosomes and the type of mutation and recombination used.</p></div></div></div>

<div class="CSection"><div class=CTopic><h2 class=CTitle><a name="Cartesian_Genetic_Programming"></a>Cartesian Genetic Programming</h2><div class=CBody><p>Now Evolutionary Algorithms have been explained CGP can be introduced.</p><p>Cartesian Genetic Programming evolves chromosomes which represent functioning programs.&nbsp; That is the solutions being evolved is a program which completes a given task.&nbsp; These programs can be symbolic equations, Boolean logic circuits, neural networks or pretty much anything which consists of connected computational elements.</p><p>CGP chromosomes describe acyclic (or sometimes cyclic) graphs of functioning nodes index by their Cartesian coordinates.&nbsp; The chromosomes are typically comprised of three types of gene: connection genes, function genes and output genes.&nbsp; Connection genes describe where each nodes inputs are connected; either to the inputs of the graph of other nodes.&nbsp; In the typical acyclic case nodes can only connect to graph inputs of previous nodes.&nbsp; Function genes describe the functionality performed by each node.&nbsp; The set of possible functions which can be performed by each node is defined by the user in a function set.&nbsp; Output genes describe which nodes in the graph represent the graph&rsquo;s output(s).&nbsp; Outputs can be any of the graph&rsquo;s inputs or any nodes within the graph.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Example Chromosome</h4><p>An example CGP chromosome is given below.&nbsp; This chromosome describes an acyclic graph comprising of three inputs, three nodes and one output.</p><img src="feedForward.png" width="482" height="144"><p>There are a few things to note form this chromosome</p><ul><li>Firstly not all of the nodes contribute the output of the graph.&nbsp; Nodes which do not contribute to the output are said to be inactive and are describe by inactive genes.&nbsp; Note: inactive genes can become active when subject to mutation.&nbsp; These inactive genes are though to enable neutral genetic drift; an evolutionary phenomenon where some genes do not contribute to the operation of the phenotype (animal).&nbsp; Neutral genetic drift is though to be useful due to inactive genes still being subject to mutation and are passed on during reproduction.&nbsp; Therefore a population which appears evolutionary static can maintain genetic diversity making it more capable to adapt to a changing environment and more easily escaping evolutionary local optima.</li><li>Secondly not all of the graphs inputs have to be used when calculating the outputs.&nbsp; This is important as sometimes it is not known which variables will be important to solve a give task.&nbsp; Here CGP can evolve solutions which only used inputs found useful during evolution.</li><li>Thirdly the outputs of nodes can be used multiple times by other nodes and graph outputs.&nbsp; This is an advantage over other genetic programming methods which typically require the same functionality to be evolved multiple times if an internally calculated value is required multiple times.</li><li>Finally the nodes are arrange in one row and multiple columns.&nbsp; Although CGP originally arrange its nodes in multiple rows and columns this constraint is now often removed.&nbsp; This is due to the fact that any topology possible with multiple rows and columns is also possible with one row and multiple columns; provided the total number of nodes remains the same and nodes can connect to to any previous nodes.&nbsp; Additionally there are topologies which are possible when using one row and multiple columns which are not possible with multiple rows and columns; making the same assumptions.&nbsp; Therefore typically for CGP (and for CGP-library) only the number of nodes (columns) is specified.</li></ul><h4 class=CHeading>Typical Evolutionary process</h4><p>Now the typical evolutionary process used by CGP shall be described.&nbsp; However nearly aspect can be altered.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Evolutionary Strategy</h4><p>The evolutionary strategy commonly used by CGP is (1 + lambda)-ES.&nbsp; This is an elitist strategy (the best chromosome is always preserved in the next generation) which includes parents and children in the next generation.&nbsp; The population size is 1 + lambda.&nbsp; Common values for lambda are four and ten.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Initial Population</h4><p>The initial population is usually populated with randomly generated chromosomes.&nbsp; The user defines the number of inputs, nodes, outputs, node arity and the function set and the chromosomes are randomly generated using these constraints.</p><p>For instance each node will be given a random function gene from the function set, each node connection will be given a random connection gene and the outputs shall index random inputs or nodes within the graph.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Calculating the Fitness</h4><p>Typically before the fitness of a CGP chromosome is calculated the active nodes are determined.&nbsp; This is because chromosomes are often ran multiple times by the fitness function and calculating the outputs of nodes which never contribute to the operation of the chromosome is a waste of computational time.&nbsp; Calculating the the active nodes is an O(n) operation which is only undertaken once for each chromosome.</p><p>To calculate the output(s) of a CGP chromosome the input(s) are loaded into the input nodes.&nbsp; Then the output of each active node is calculated in tern starting at those closest to the input(s) and working towards the output(s).&nbsp; Finally the outputs of the output node(s) are used as the chromosome output(s).</p><p>The exact fitness of the chromosomes depend on the given task but typically lower fitnesses represent a better solution.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Selection Scheme</h4><p>CGP typically selects the mu fittest chromosomes to become the parents.</p><h4 class=CHeading>Reproduction Scheme</h4><p>CGP typically only uses mutation alone to create the lambda children form the parents.&nbsp; Common mutation methods used are probabilistic mutation and point mutation.</p><p>Probabilistic mutation changes each gene to a new random valid allele with a given probability.&nbsp; This allows for the number of genes actually mutated to have a Gaussian distribution.&nbsp; Point mutation randomly selects a given number of genes in the parent and mutates these to create the child.&nbsp; The number of genes selected is the mutation rate time the number of genes.&nbsp; This fixes the number of genes mutated.</p></div></div></div>
