Title: Installation

First download CGP-Library from http://www.andrewjamesturner.co.uk and unzip the file.

Simplest:

The simplest method of using CGP-Library is to add cgp.c and cgp.h to your build path and compile them along with your own files.   

For instance #include "cgp.h" and then compile your program similar too

    >$ gcc yourFiles.c cgp.c cgp.h 


Standard:

A more standard way of using libraries is to install them system wide for use by any program. For this the library must be compiled into a system specific shared library file and then installed.

Ubuntu:

To generate the shared object (.so) open a terminal in the CGP-Library directory and run

    >$ make so
    
Then copy the generated libcgp.so to /usr/lib by running

    >$ sudo cp libcgp.so /usr/lib
    
Give libcgp.so the necessary permissions by running

    >$ sudo chmod 0755 /usr/lib/libcgp.so

Now copy cgp.h to /usr/include by running

    >$ sudo cp src/include/cgp.h /usr/include/

Finally update the system so it knows about libcgp.so

    >$ sudo ldconfig
    
Once CGP-Library has been installed it can be accessed by #include <cgp.h> in your project and linking using the -lcgp flag. Similar too

    >$ gcc yourFiles.c -lcgp
