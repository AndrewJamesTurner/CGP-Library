Title: Installation 

First download CGP-Library from http://www.andrewjamesturner.co.uk and unzip the file.

Simplest:

The simplest method of using CGP-Library is to add cgp.c and cgp.h to your build path and compile them along with your own files.   

For instance #include "cgp.h" and then compile your program similar too

    >$ gcc yourFiles.c cgp.c cgp.h 


Standard:

A more standard way of using libraries is to link against them. For this the library must be compiled into a system specific shared library file.

Ubuntu:

To compile the shared object (.so) open a terminal in the CGP-Library directory and run

    >$ make so
    
Then copy the generated libcgp.so to /usr/lib by running

    >$ sudo cp libcgp.so /usr/lib
    
Give libcgp.so the necessary permissions by running

    >$ sudo chmod 0755 /usr/lib/libcgp.so

Now copy cgp.h to /usr/include by running

    >$ sudo cp include/cgp.h /usr/include/

Finally update the system so it knows about libcgp.so

    >$ sudo ldconfig
    
Once CGP-Library has been installed it can be used by #include <cgp.h> in your project and linking against the .so using the -lcgp compiler flag. Similar too

    >$ gcc yourFiles.c -lcgp

Windows:

For windows the .dll has been pre-compiled. So the complier should be linked to the provided CGP-Library.dll; how this is done is IDE dependant. Then simply #include "cgp.h".
