Title: About  

CGP-Library is a Cartesian Genetic Programming implementation designed to be simple to use whilst being highly extendible. Information relating to Cartesian Genetic Programming is maintained at <http://www.cartesiangp.co.uk/> which includes a ten slide introduction <http://www.cartesiangp.co.uk/cgp-in-nutshell.pdf>.

Intended Use:

CGP-Library was designed with three use cases in mind

1) Teaching and learning about CGP

2) Undertaking academic research into CGP

3) Using CGP for real world applications

As a result the basic use of CGP-Library is very simple (see <Getting Started>) but is also highly customisable and extendible.

Tutorials:

A number of tutorials are provided to walk you though using the CGG-Library. For those familiar with the open source cross platform IDE Code::Blocks (<http://www.codeblocks.org/>), a project is also provided which contains all of the tutorial source files (on ubuntu you may also need to also insall xterm for codeblocks to run the programs in its default terminal). 

Although the tutorials cover basic and advance usage they do not cover every function described in the <API>.

Open Source:

CGP-Library is open source'd under the LGPL, which means you have access to the source files as well as the complied library. See <Licenses> for more details. The CGP-Library project is hosted on github at <https://github.com/AndrewJamesTurner/CGP-Library>.
