Title: About  

CGP-Library is a cross platform Cartesian Genetic Programming library designed to be simple to use whilst being highly extendible. The library is written in C (with binding to python and Java possibly coming soon) and is compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac OS. 

Information relating to Cartesian Genetic Programming is maintained at <http://www.cartesiangp.co.uk/> which includes a ten slide introduction <http://www.cartesiangp.co.uk/cgp-in-nutshell.pdf>. This documentation also includes a short introduction to CGP in <Cartesian Genetic Programming>.

Intended Use:

CGP-Library was designed with three use cases in mind

1) Teaching and learning about CGP

2) Undertaking academic research into CGP 

3) Using CGP for real world applications

As a result the basic use of CGP-Library is very simple (see <Getting Started>) but is also highly customisable and extendible.

Tutorials:

A number of tutorials are provided to introduce new users to the CGP-Library. For those familiar with the open source cross platform IDE Code::Blocks (<http://www.codeblocks.org/>), a code::blocks project file is also provided which contains all of the tutorial source files (under Ubuntu you may also need to also install xterm for code::blocks to run the programs in its default terminal). 

Although the tutorials cover basic and advance usage they do not cover every function specified in the <API> so be sure to give it a read.
