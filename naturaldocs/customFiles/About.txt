Title: About

CGP-Library is a cross platform Cartesian Genetic Programming implementation designed to be simple to use whilst being highly extendable. The library is written in C and is compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac OS.
The CGP-Library implements the following:
	* Cartesian Genetic Programming
	* Recurrent Cartesian Genetic Programming
	* Cartesian Genetic Programming of Artificial Neural Networks
	* Recurrent Cartesian Genetic Programming of Artificial Neural Networks

Information relating to Cartesian Genetic Programming is maintained at <http://www.cartesiangp.co.uk/> which includes a ten slide introduction <http://www.cartesiangp.co.uk/cgp-in-nutshell.pdf>. This documentation also includes a short introduction to CGP in <Cartesian Genetic Programming>.

Title: News

*CGP-Lirary 2.4 has been released!* Grab this latest version from the <Downloads> page. This update brings support for multiple threads and minor bug fixes.

Title: Tutorials

A number of tutorials are provided to introduce users to the CGP-Library and many of its features. New users should download the CGP-Library from <Downloads> and then follow the <Installation> and <Getting Started> tutorials.

For those familiar with the open source cross platform IDE Code::Blocks (<http://www.codeblocks.org/>), a Code::Blocks project file is also provided which contains all of the tutorial source files (under Ubuntu you may also need to also install xterm for code::blocks to run the programs in its default terminal).
