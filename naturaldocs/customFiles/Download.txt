Title: Download

The current and previous versions of CGP-Library will be available here for download.

Version: 2.4:
	
		* *Added multiple thread support via openMP*
		* Added <getNumChromosomeActiveConnections>
		* Fixed bug in the pow function
		* Wrapped cgp.h in an extern "C" for compatibility with c++ compilers 
Version: 2.3:

		* Fixed bug where the number of inputs passed into a given node was always set to the max arity.
		* Fixed bug where it was possible (although unlikely) for a parent to be selected over a child even if they have equal fitness (due to using an unstable sort).
		* The index of nodes displayed using <printChromosomes> now match those displayed using <saveChromosomeDot>.
